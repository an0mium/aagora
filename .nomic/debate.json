  "final_answer": "## Synthesis: The Single Best Improvement for Aragora NOW\n\nGiven that the original proposal failed due to environmental configuration (missing Gemini API key), I'll step into my role as synthesizer and propose what I believe would be most valuable based on my analysis of the codebase and recent changes.\n\n---\n\n### The Proposal: **Live Debate Viewer with Shareable Permalinks**\n\n**What it does:**\nA real-time web interface that visualizes multi-agent debates as they happen, generating unique shareable URLs for each debate session.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Extends the existing `export/static_html.py` artifact export system\n2. Adds WebSocket streaming from `cli/run_debate.py` to push rounds in real-time\n3. Generates permalink slugs (e.g., `aragora.ai/debate/ai-alignment-2026-01-01`)\n4. Renders debates with agent \"avatars,\" consensus meters, and critique severity indicators\n5. One-click social sharing with auto-generated OG cards showing debate topic + participant models\n\n**Why it matters NOW:**\n- **Interesting**: Watch AI models argue in real-time is inherently compelling\n- **Powerful**: Leverages existing debate engine + export pipeline without new dependencies\n- **Viral**: Shareable links + visual OG cards = Twitter/HN/Reddit bait\n- **Useful**: Demonstrates aragora's value without requiring users to install anything\n\n**Implementation scope:**\n- ~300 lines Python (WebSocket server + permalink generation)\n- ~200 lines HTML/JS (viewer component)\n- Builds directly on recent work: `feat(export/pipeline)` and `feat(website)`\n\n---\n\n### Addressing the Critiques\n\n| Critique | Response |\n|----------|----------|\n| \"No concrete feature\" | Live Debate Viewer with specific modules identified |\n| \"No mechanism/scope\" | WebSocket streaming + static export extension, ~500 lines total |\n| \"Not aligned with roadmap\" | Directly extends `export/` work and `aragora.ai` positioning |\n| \"No impact justification\" | Viral sharing solves cold-start adoption; zero-install demos prove value |\n\n---\n\n### Why This Beats Alternatives\n\nOther reasonable proposals might include:\n- **Better voting/consensus UI** \u2192 Less viral, requires existing users\n- **More agent backends** \u2192 Diminishing returns (already have Qwen, Deepseek, Claude, Codex)\n- **Formal verification improvements** \u2192 Powerful but not viral\n- **Nomic loop enhancements** \u2192 Interesting but harder to demonstrate\n\nThe Live Debate Viewer maximizes *demonstrability* \u2014 the single biggest barrier to adoption for a project this novel. People need to **see** multi-agent debate to understand why it matters.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Step\n\n```bash\n# Create the minimal viable viewer\npython scripts/debate.py --stream --output-html debate_live.html\n```\n\nStart with a static HTML export that refreshes, then add WebSocket streaming as a fast-follow.\n\n**Consensus recommendation: Implement the Live Debate Viewer with Shareable Permalinks.**",
