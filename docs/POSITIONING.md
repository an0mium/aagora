# Aragora: Product Positioning Brief

*Strategic positioning for B2B market validation*

---

## What Aragora Is

**Aragora is a self-improving multi-agent debate infrastructure** that enables organizations to achieve higher-confidence decisions through adversarial AI reasoning.

### Core Value Proposition

> "When a single AI tells you an answer, you get an opinion. When multiple AIs debate, critique, and verify each other's reasoning, you get truth-tested intelligence."

---

## What Aragora Is NOT

- **Not a chatbot** - No consumer-facing conversational UI
- **Not a wrapper** - Not another LLM API aggregator
- **Not a copilot** - Not a coding assistant or productivity tool

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Nomic Loop (Self-Improvement)
Aragora uniquely implements autonomous self-improvement where:
- Agents debate proposed changes to the system itself
- Winning proposals get implemented by the system
- Verification ensures safety before deployment

*No other framework improves itself through structured debate.*

### 2. Adversarial Critique
Multi-agent debate with:
- Structured propose-critique-revise cycles
- Cross-model verification (Claude vs GPT vs Gemini)
- Consensus detection with confidence scoring

*Reduces single-point-of-failure hallucination risk.*

### 3. Formal Verification
Integration with:
- Z3 SMT solver for logical proofs
- Lean theorem prover for mathematical verification
- Evidence citation chains with provenance tracking

*Goes beyond "trust me" to "here's the proof."*

### 4. Truth Grounding
Position tracking and calibration:
- Agents record stance changes with justifications
- Calibration scoring measures prediction accuracy
- Belief networks propagate evidence updates

*Quantifies reasoning quality over time.*
