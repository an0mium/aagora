## Consensus vs Divergence

### High Convergence (80%+) - Prioritize

1. **Adversarial validation is the core value proposition**
   - All agents agree Aragora's strength is adversarial testing
   - "Debate" framing is too passive; "attack" framing resonates

2. **Target high-stakes decision makers**
   - CTOs and executives with budget authority
   - Avoid developer-only positioning (too crowded)

3. **Emphasize speed and comprehensiveness**
   - "12+ perspectives in hours, not weeks"
   - Quantifiable ROI vs. consulting alternatives

### Moderate Convergence (50-80%) - Validate

1. **Regulatory compliance angle**
   - Strong in EU-focused markets
   - May be secondary positioning in US

2. **Formal verification as differentiator**
   - Technical users value it
   - May confuse business buyers

### Low Convergence (<50%) - Explore

1. **Gamification/entertainment**
   - Grok's "Battle Royale" angle
   - Could be viral growth mechanism

2. **Open-source community**
   - Llama's positioning
   - Long-term trust-building strategy

## Recommended Synthesis

Based on convergence analysis, the optimal positioning combines:

**Primary Message**: "Adversarial Validation Engine for High-Stakes Decisions"
- Combines red team + decision focus
- Avoids both "too academic" and "too playful"

**Secondary Messages**:
1. For Compliance: "AI Act compliance stress-testing"
2. For Developers: "Gauntlet mode for code reviews"
3. For Executives: "Cognitive insurance for $10M decisions"

**Deferred for Later**:
- Gamification elements (Phase 3)
- Open-source community edition (Phase 4)
